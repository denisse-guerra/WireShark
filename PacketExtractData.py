This program is intented to extract information from a whireshark packet capture in text file format and print it to the user. 
The values extracted are frame number, the source and destination addresses, and the frame type.

def extract_frame(packet_filename):
    """
    This function opens the packet capture text file in read mode and fragments the content of each line in a list, to get the frame number,
    the source and destination addresses, and the frame type.
    The commented sections of the function are for finding the occurences of IP Addresses
    and more below, printing the lists for troubleshooting.
    
    Parameters:
    packet_filename(str): The name of a .txt file containing network packets.
